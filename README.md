# Arduino soundplay

Simple functions and example code to implement a simple 8bit-PCM or 1-bit BTC audio player.
Needs Timer2 and works on ATmega328p.

For infos regarding BTc see http://www.romanblack.com/picsound.htm
This method of 1-bit sound encoding is a great flash memory space saver, but does not seem to encode equally well for all sound samples.
